# Demo.AspNetCore.Htmx

An example of using ASP.NET Core MVC with HTMX.
You can look at each commit from the beginning to see how HTMX was integrated into the application.

The focus here is on htmx, not css.
I used the original ASP.NET Core MVC template as a starting point and the *New Scaffolded Item* dialog in Visual Studio to create controllers and views.
During the htmx integration, I only made minor design changes that I needed.
